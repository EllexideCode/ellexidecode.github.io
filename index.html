        <h1 class="header">Hey, I'm Ellexide!</h1>
        <p>
          Though I'm often known as <span class="grace blurple">Elle</span>. Welcome to my little hidey-hole. I do coding and layouts for all kinds of people as well as all kinds of uses--not just for roleplay profiles. Though if you're looking at this, you probably know me for that specific type of coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a lot of sections to this mini-website so feel free to poke around. If you need any help, don't hesitate to mail me on RPC on this account, or shoot me a DM in Discord: <b class="blurple">Lil Monster#3557</b> or if you don't have Discord you can mail me on: <a href="mailto:ellexidecodes@gmail.com" class="blurple">ellexidecodes@gmail.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          As of the moment, <span class="blurple">I am currently taking commissions.</span> Just drop me a DM and we'll discuss details.~
        </p>
        <p>
          I have very few rules when it comes to my layouts, all revolving around respect for my work. These rules are as follows:
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li><b class="greyple">Do not redistribute my code.</b> I worked really hard on it. All I ask is for respect for my work.</li>
            <li><b class="greyple">Do not remove any of my credits--both in the hidden CSS as well as visible credit.</b> This includes the copyright and all the associated links.</li>
            <li><b class="greyple">Do not search for, decipher, try to obtain, or copy any part of the code.</b> They are hidden for a reason. With my copyright, I am eligible to sue you for theft of intellectual property. I don't wish to let it ever get that far.</li>
          </ul>
          As I said, I only ask for a few things. In return for all your patience, support, and respect for my work, I will do my best to give you a pleasant working experience with me as well as ever growing skills and experience. This way, I can continue to give you the best outputs I can offer.
        </p>

      <div class="scroller">
        <h1 class="header">Updates</h1>
        <h2>03/1/2019</h2>
        <p>
          Quoting my previous promise: "I will keep things all in one place so you guys don't have to open links to find my code." I have made well with that promise, my darlings! If you go to <b class="unset-style" opens="#gallery">my gallery</b> you will find free codes in a different section at the bottom. When you click "View Source", it will open up a different section that contains the code. You can then choose to view only the CSS, so you can easily copy paste into your <b>STYLE</b> box, view HTML only so you can copy straight into your <b>BODY</b> box, or view the full code to see how long it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a quick button to copy the current code portrayed. So basically you can: View CSS only, Copy Code, paste into RPC. View HTML only > Copy Code > Paste in RPC. <b class="blurple">Badaing, badaboom, am I helpful in making it eaSY TO GET CODES OR WHAT!</b> <i class="greyple">Whips in white.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Sorry for the enthusiasm, I was just excited to share this aspect so you guys won't have to look fuken everywhere for my code. It will always still be in pastebin though if you guys want to go there instead.

        <h2>02/28/2019</h2>
        <p>
          Hey, hey! So, here is the next major overhaul of my profile! Now, you may ask, "Elle! Where is your commissioned art?" Well, about that... It actually hasn't arrived yet. <b class="blurple">But</b> I have had the desire to change my look for so long now that I just couldn't wait! I promise it's coming. I'm just as excited to see it as you are (assuming you are excited to see it).
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm hoping this format makes it easier for you guys to read, navigate, as well as just look more pleasing than my previous one. <i class="greyple">I honestly don't know what I was thinking, honsestly. Please spare me.</i> Initially, I was all down for it but the more I opened my profile the more I hated it. <b class="blurple">I NEEDED A NEW ONE AND FAST.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          What do you guys think of this new layout? Give me a shout!

        <h2>Basic Information:</h2>
        <p>
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>The bulk of all codes are all backed up and hosted elsewhere. This does <b class="blurple">not</b> mean that you will not be able to edit it. You can still edit it through the given variables.</li>
            <li>I reserve the right to demand that you take down my layout if I see fit. The reasons for having the code taken down will one or more of the following:</li>
            <ul class="inner">
              <li>Claiming my code as your own.</li>
              <li>Removed credit from my code and refused to put it back--either explicitly or refusal to reply to any contact.</li>
              <li>Copied a large chunk of any of my code that is not under the MIT license.</li>
              <li>You have been blacklisted from using my codes before.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>I offer <b class="blurple">more</b> than just roleplay.chat profile code layouts. I also offer:</li>
            <ul class="inner">
              <li>Room Website Coding</li>
              <li>Personal Portfolio Coding</li>
              <li>Profile Edits (either codes made by me or someone else)</li>
              <li>Image Editing</li>
            </ul>
            <li>My codes will take time usually because I have work and school but I will always inform you if I end up taking longer than necessary.</li>

        <h2>Commissions <i class="blurple">(Open)</i></h2>
        <p>
          My commissions are often open though the available slots often change depending on how busy I can get. Though, if you are willing to wait until I am able to accomodate you then feel free to head over to <b class="blurple"><span class="unset-style" opens="#list">my on-going list</span></b> to see who is on my waiting list, who I am accomodating, and what stage I am with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I am accomodating you, I will have complete transparency and try to maintain constant communication as I work through your profile. Some basic things to remember:
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>I do not take less than <b class="blurple">15USD</b> for codes that use CSS/HTML</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I do not take less than <b class="blurple">20USD</b> for codes that use JS/CSS/HTML</li>
            <li>I will ask you for your budget so the higher the budget range, the more complex the code. But this also means that I might be asking for a higher base price so please <i class="greyple">be honest when you give me a budget range.</i> Giving me a higher budget than what you can actually afford thus making me work harder and using up time and skill, all the while planning to pay me on the low end is also unfair. It <b>is</b> still considered labor.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The process will be as follows:
          <ol>
            <li><b class="greyple">Consultation</b> - I will be asking you a series of questions that pertain to the character you want me to make a profile of. They are very simplye questions like "What is the aura you want portrayed in the profile?" or "Do you have a theme in mind?" This will happen immediately when you are added to my commission list. If you are on the waiting list, I will not be doing a consultation with you.
            <li><b class="greyple">Visualization</b> - After the the Consultation and when I am ready to start working on your layout, I will be going over the first imagery I can think of for your profile. This stage does not stop until I am able to deliver to you the final output.</li>
            <li><b class="greyple">Transaction</b> - Assuming we have passed the Visualization stage and you are already content with the layout I have given you a full preview of, I will start to compress the code for your consumption while sending you a link for the payment. I will not be asking for you to pay upfront or pay half. The only time I will take your money is when you are ready to receive your code. Once I have received the official receipt and e-mail from PayPal, your code will be sent to you along with a quick documentation if it is needed.</li>
            <li><b class="greyple">Grace Period</b> - 7 days after you have received your profile, you are eligible to ask major changes from me. They will all be for free as you are entitled to it. After that, I will always be available for small changes as well as code support. But if you want something that could essentially be a layout change, I <i class="greyple">might</i> ask for a small fee. Eitherway, you are welcome to ask me for changes even after 7 days just to see if it is something I can do for free or not.</li>
          </ol>
